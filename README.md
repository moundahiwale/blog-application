# BlogApplication

A simple blog application developed using Angular 10 where a user can view blog posts, add and edit comments.    
The project demonstrates following key features of Angular:  
Components, services, routing, resolvers, pipes, directives to avoid code duplication (e.g. [ng-container](./src/app/components/posts/posts-list/posts-list.component.html)), forms module to create template driven forms, code separation best practices, using Angular Material for theming and creating UI components, etc.  

## Work In Progress   
1. Accessibility: some basic keyboard navigation and screen reader testing has been performed and a detailed review is needed.  
2. Writing tests  
3. Error Handling  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
